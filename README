This repository contains some scripts that I find useful in day to day work with Linux.

LaTeX:
- compress-pdf - Script that minimizes the size of pdf document.
- generate - (LEGACY - instead use latexmk) A script that compiles multifile latex documents and assures clean workspace.

git:
- lsgit - Script that looks for all git repositories in the system and then list them including their current branch and status.

ROS:
- bag_splitter - A python script that splits ros-bag files into even sised parts. NOTE! reindex each part afterwards http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Commandline#reindex

bash:
- autocompile.sh - A bash script that automatically detects if a source file has changed in order to run compilation code. Originally designed to work with Asymptote.
